DO NOT ADD ANY FILE OTHER THAN THE DEPENDENCIES.

Lab5 Note:
1. Additional code to clear screen is in branch clearscreenv2, the major thing I added is when sw(8) is flipped up, the clock is speedup and start to clearscreen. So when you try to merge, look at the the clock part and the beginning of the statemachine.
2. I think you already have an idea to do the player pad. For ball you will probably need two signal to control the direction of increment/decrement 0,0/0,1/1,0/1,1 meaning four directions. Then two differnet processes, one to draw and one to erase.

Cheers and GL!
